# MEAN-Full-Stack-Website

In order to demonstrate my proficiency in a variety of modern web technologies, I have created a full stack website using the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js. Additionally, Handlebars was used for templating and Postman was used for API testing. As of June 2024, these technologies are commonly used in the web development industry.

I started this project with very little experience in these technologies and limited knowledge of Javascript, Typescript, HTML, or CSS. Consequently, I was required to learn the basic workings of Express.js and Angular, which introduced me to new terms such as MVC architecture, asynchronous functions, and Angular directives. I then built on top of my foundational knowledge to implement features such as API calls, security features, and database queries.

Web systems can be complex. With many different pieces working in tandem, a solid separation of concerns and testing paradigm is all but necessary. Accordingly, I strove to minimize the complexity of each component and to test components early and often. The testing process improved my diagnostics comprehension and taught me proper error handling.

This project has given me a great foundation for a career in web development. The process of learning the aforementioned technologies served not just to make them useable, but to hone my researching and problem-solving skills. In total, the experience of building a full stack application has given me a greater understanding and confidence in the field of web development.
